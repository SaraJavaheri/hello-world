Hello to the world,

It's Sunday and I am at work, learning how to use Github during my lunch break!!! I like science, poetry, art, music, DARK CHOCOLATE, and food (like "real food") ;) I want to change the world by being a part of cancer research project and I know that I am going to be the one! :)
